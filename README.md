# Embedded FLIP

Replication of the FLIP protocol (version 0) as presented in the followning paper:

> I. Solis and Katia Obraczka, [“FLIP: A Flexible Interconnection Protocol for Heterogeneous Internetworking”](https://inrg.soe.ucsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/flip-monet.pdf), ACM/Kluwer Mobile Networking and Applications (MONET) Special on Integration of Heterogeneous Wireless Technologies.

Implementation Includes FLIP and GTP in C++ for embedded platforms such as Arduinos, Raspberry Pi's, and other platforms supporting C/C++. 

Diffusion and Aggregation is left as future work.
